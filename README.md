## About
Security Now Downloader for easy downloading of netcasts/podcasts.

## History
This BASH-script was written quite a few years ago to simplify the process of downloading one of my favourite podcasts, i.e. _Security Now_, with _Steve Gibson_ and _Leo Laporte_.

I had no intention to make it public but used it for my own convenience along the lines of the aforementioned until posting it on the GRC newsgroup. Eventually it faded away in my memory until a short while ago when I was Googling my own handle, i.e. _DevTactix_. To my big surprise a contributor to the said newgroup named _Seth Leedy_ had written a couple of blog posts on the topic of Security Now download scripts. Internet is amazing! :)

Seth Leedy wrote his own [script](https://github.com/sethleedy/GRC-SECURITY-NOW-PODCAST-DOWNLOAD-SCRIPT) (much better) inspired by what I had published. Thanks Seth!

I recommend you check out his blog posts on the matter and there you will find links to his scripts and a full background of the discussion in which I contributed what you are now finding here on the emptiest corner of GitHub.
